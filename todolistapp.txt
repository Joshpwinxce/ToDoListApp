It seems like your React application is trying to fetch data from http://localhost:8000/todos, but it's returning a 404 error, indicating that the resource is not found. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and fix this issue:

1. **Check the Server Endpoint**: Ensure that the server is running and listening for requests on http://localhost:8000. Also, verify that there's a route configured to handle GET requests to `/todos` and that it returns the expected data.

2. **Verify the Path**: Double-check the path used in your Axios request (`http://localhost:8000/todos`). If the server endpoint is different or the route path is incorrect, you'll encounter a 404 error.

3. **Inspect Network Requests**: Use your browser's developer tools to inspect network requests. This will allow you to see the exact request being made and the response received. It can help identify any issues with the request or server response.

4. **Check CORS Configuration**: If your React app is running on a different port or domain than the server (e.g., React app on port 3000 and server on port 8000), ensure that Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is properly configured on the server to allow requests from your React app's domain.

5. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling in your Axios request to handle 404 errors gracefully. This could involve displaying a meaningful message to the user or logging the error for debugging purposes.

6. **Backend Debugging**: If everything seems correct on the frontend, but you're still getting a 404 error, double-check the server-side code to ensure that the `/todos` route is correctly implemented and that it returns the expected data.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue causing the 404 error when fetching data in your React application.It seems like your React application is trying to fetch data from http://localhost:8000/todos, but it's returning a 404 error, indicating that the resource is not found.

The error message indicates that your POST request to `/todos` is resulting in a 404 Not Found error. This means that the server is unable to find the endpoint `/todos` to handle the POST 
request.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that:

1. The server is running and properly configured to handle requests to `/todos`.
2. The server has an endpoint configured to handle POST requests to `/todos`.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Check Server Configuration**: Make sure that your server is correctly configured to handle requests to the `/todos` endpoint. This might involve setting up routing or defining a 
handler for POST requests to `/todos` in your server code.

2. **Verify Endpoint Existence**: Double-check that the `/todos` endpoint exists on your server and that it is capable of handling POST requests. You can do this by inspecting your 
server code or documentation.

3. **Verify Server URL**: Ensure that the server URL (`http://localhost:8000`) is correct and that the server is running on the specified port (8000 in this case).

4. **Check Server Logs**: Check the server logs for any errors or warnings that might provide more information about why the `/todos` endpoint is not found.

Once you've identified and addressed the issue with the server configuration or endpoint, you should be able to successfully add todos without encountering the 404 error.
